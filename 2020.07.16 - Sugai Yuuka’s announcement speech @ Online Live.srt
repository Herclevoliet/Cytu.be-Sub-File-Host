1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,230
Once again for those supporting Keyakizaka46

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,510
arigatou gozaimasu

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,780
And then for everything so far in this live stream

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,950
to those who have been watching

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,160
arigatou gozaimasu

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,160
arigatou gozaimasu~

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,670
Its been so long since we've done a concert

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,970
Those who have always been there to support us

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,880
its been awhile since you've seen us moving around on stage

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,630
with all of us wanting to deliver the power from the messages in our songs

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,030
its been awhile since they've let us put on a performance for you

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,480
Hopefully you were able to recapture all those feelings again?

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,020
And then right here

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,990
all of us have a message for all of you

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,200
We the members of Keyakizaka46

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,170
are closing the curtains on our 5 years of history

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,100
And then regarding Keyakizaka46

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,610
we will remain positive as we say goodbye

19
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,300
In October...Keyakizaka46 is scheduled

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,960
to have a final concert

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,600
As Keyakizaka46

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,540
that event will mark the end of the group's activities

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,100
And then

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,310
we will be given a new group name...there will be a rebirth

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
Of course this decision

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,910
is not something all the members can take in and accept so quickly

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,740
For us personally we have an incredibly strong emotional attachment to Keyakizaka46

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,820
To keep going with these mixed feelings....there is no way we'd be allowed to continue with this group as it is

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,560
Me personally and the Keyakizaka46 that I love

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,980
I was hoping I'd be able to protect it forever

31
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,040
and I worked to protect it

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,600
However

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,570
however

34
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,690
in order for this group to become much much stronger

35
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,050
following all the discussions between the staff and the members

36
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,920
The decision was that now is the time to move forward

37
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,650
Its because we are Keyakizaka46

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,260
that a lot of our dreams have come true

39
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,130
Including the members not here with us now

40
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,010
our dreams came true together and then

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,310
its because you were all there supporting us

42
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,420
you made so many of our dreams come true

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,670
The members who gave us strength and all the staff

44
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,670
and then the wonderful songs

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,570
and then the truly wonderful creative team

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,630
and then

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,940
the countless number of fans I've had a chance to meet truly makes me proud

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,190
Really up to now

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,240
getting to be a part of Keyakizaka46

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,270
I grew to love Keyakizaka46

51
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,160
and all the support Keyakizaka46 has given me

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,420
I truly want to say....arigatou gozaimashita

53
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,080
arigatou gozaimashita

54
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,730
But along with all the fun memories

55
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,220
to be honest there's been a lot of painful memories

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,340
In these 2 years especially

57
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,880
its felt like we've been walking lost in a tunnel with no visible exit

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,390
There were so many unpredictable events

59
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,570
and there were days we couldn't do our job the way we had hoped

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,060
There's been days where we wondered if we had let everyone down

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,220
And then members continued to graduate and withdraw

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,090
The group name took on a life of its own

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,940
there were days with events so troubling that it made you want to cover your ears from the outside world

64
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,120
But Keyakizaka46

65
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,690
the more I think about how much I loved it

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
it starts to hurt

67
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,610
more and more I think about what I should have done

68
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,330
It feels like I've become obsessed with thinking about it

69
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,640
Right now

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,660
for the group to become strong

71
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,900
the new members that joined...the 2nd members and new 2nd members

72
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
and then 1st members....all 28 of us together

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,480
From here we must get off to a new start

74
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,150
and again we'll all have to work hard to get back to where a lot of our dreams can come true

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,790
And then

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,200
in order to become strong in the future..up to this point

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,990
the things we've held precious will have to be let go

78
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,620
and in that open space

79
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,010
I truly believe something new and precious can once again fill that void

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,930
From this point on our restart begins

81
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,770
I think a treacherous road awaits us

82
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,550
however

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,020
with us becoming a colorless group with a clean slate again

84
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,320
together I'd like to fill those colors in

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,820
All the experience gained in Keyakizaka46

86
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,430
I'm sure it has made us tougher

87
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,410
because of that we'll believe in our experience

88
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,980
and then

89
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,240
once again

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,080
I promise we will become a strong group

91
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,130
with that said

92
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,830
from now on as well

93
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,230
please expect big things from us

94
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,320
In the future....your continued support

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
dozo yoroshiku onegai itashimasu

96
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,090
yoroshiku onegaishimasu

97
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,630
For our last song

98
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,230
this will be Keyakizaka46's last single

99
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,230
please listen
